<p><b>Malady: Multiclass active learning with auction dynamics on graphs</b>
</p>
<p>Active learning enhances the performance of machine learning methods, particularly in low-label rate scenarios, by judiciously selecting a limited number of unlabeled data points for labeling, with the goal of improving the performance of an underlying classifier. In this work, we introduce the Multiclass Active Learning with Auction Dynamics on Graphs (MALADY) algorithm, which leverages an auction dynamics technique on similarity graphs for efficient active learning. In particular, the proposed algorithm incorporates an active learning loop using as its underlying semi-supervised procedure an efficient and effective similarity graph-based auction method consisting of upper and lower bound auctions that integrate class size constraints. In addition, we introduce a novel active learning acquisition function that incorporates the dual variable of the auction algorithm to measure the uncertainty in the classifier to prioritize queries near the decision boundaries between different classes. Overall, the proposed method can efficiently obtain accurate results using extremely small labeled sets containing just a few elements per class; this is crucial since labeled data is scarce for many applications. Moreover, the proposed technique can incorporate class size information, which improves accuracy even further. Lastly, using experiments on classification tasks and various data sets, we evaluate the performance of our proposed method and show that it exceeds that of comparison algorithms.</p>

<p><b>Persistent Laplacian-enhanced Algorithm for Scarcely Labeled Data Classification</b>
</p>
<p><i>Fall 2022 - Spring 2023</i>
</p>
<p> The success of many machine learning (ML) methods depends crucially on having large amounts of labeled data. However, obtaining enough labeled data can be expensive, time-consuming, and subject to ethical constraints for many applications. One approach that has shown tremendous value in addressing this challenge is semi-supervised learning (SSL); this technique utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data during training, often with much less labeled data than unlabeled data, which is often relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain. In fact, SSL methods are particularly useful in applications where the cost of labeling data is especially expensive, such as medical analysis, natural language processing (NLP), or speech recognition. A subset of SSL methods that have achieved great success in various domains involves algorithms that integrate graph-based techniques. These procedures are popular due to the vast amount of information provided by the graphical framework and the versatility of their applications. In this work, we propose an algebraic topology-based semi-supervised method called persistent Laplacian-enhanced graph MBO (PL-MBO) by integrating persistent spectral graph theory with the classical Merriman-Bence- Osher (MBO) scheme. Specifically, we use a filtration procedure to generate a sequence of chain complexes and associated families of simplicial complexes, from which we construct a family of persistent Laplacians. Overall, it is a very efficient procedure that requires much less labeled data to perform well compared to many ML techniques, and it can be adapted for both small and large datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on data classification, and the results indicate that the proposed technique outperforms other existing semi-supervised algorithms.

<p><b>Honors College Thesis: Twisted Central Configurations of the Eight-Body problem</b>
</p>
<p><i>The University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, MS </i>
</p>
<p> I did an honors project advised by Professor <a href="https://www.math.usm.edu/xie/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> Zhifu Xie </a>. I studied a special type of central configuration: twisted central configurations of the eight-body problem. We showed that when the
two square configurations have a common centroid, the configuration can form a central
configuration only if the ratio of the size of the two squares falls into one of three intervals.
Moreover there are some numerical evidences that there are exactly three nested central
configurations for each given mass ratio m1/m5.

Wright W. and Annie Rea Cross Research: Central configurations in the planar 6-body problem forming two equilateral triangles</b>
</p>
<p><i>The University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, MS</i>
</p>
<p> I was fortunate to get Wright W. and Annie Rea Cross Mathematics Undergraduate Research Scholarship. As a cross scholar, I worked with Professor <a href="https://www.math.usm.edu/xie/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> Zhifu Xie </a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamas-tahir-111710b8/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;> Hamas Tahir </a> on this project. In this project, six bodies are located on two equilateral triangles 123 and 456. Assume that both triangles are symmetrical about the line connecting m3 and m4. Within these configurations, the six body configuration is not a central configuration if the triangle 123
 is above or below the triangle 456. It is also not a central configuration if more than two of the six bodies are collinear. When the two equilateral triangle configurations have a common centroid, masses on each equilateral triangles must be same respectively and the configuration can form a central configuration only if the ratio of the lengths of the sides between
 123 and 456 falls into one of five intervals. Moreover there are some numerical evidences that, first there are exactly two nested central configurations but there may be one, two, or three twisted nested CCs for a given mass ratio; and second, there exists central configurations other than same centroid.
